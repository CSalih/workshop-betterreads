Time: *50 minutes*. Difficulty: *Intermediate*. [Start Building](#lets-start)

A full-featured Spring Application on top of Cassandra showing

* **Astra DB** (a Database-as-a-service built on Apache Cassandra)
* **Spring Data:** the Object Mapping layer of Spring
* **Spring Security:** how to handle authentication
* **Spring MVC:** how to expose REST API and controllers
* **Thymeleaf:** how to build a user interface with Spring
* **Spring Test:** How to run tests

This application has been built by [**Java Brains**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q), a great youtuber. On his channel you can find the full *Code with me Series*, 16 episodes for building this application step-by-step.

## Objectives

* Build an app end-to-end application with Spring boot **that scales** !
* Understand how to connect to Cassandra and Astra with Spring

## Frequently asked questions

- *Can I run the workshop on my computer?*

> You don't have to, it's all already in the cloud! But there is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
> If you do so, you will need
> * git installed on your local system
> * Java 11+ Install on your local system
> * Maven Install on your local system

> In this `README`, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that
the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence **We can't guarantee any live support** about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.

- *What other prerequisites are required?*

> * You will need a GitHub account
> * You will also need an Astra account: don't worry about this if you don't already have one, we'll work through that in the following

- *Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?*
> * **No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

- *Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?*

> Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homeworks detailed below and you will get a nice participation certificate a.k.a. badge.


## Materials for the Session

It doesn't matter if you join our workshop live or you prefer to work at your own pace,
we have you covered. In this repository, you'll find everything you need for this workshop:

## Homework

# Let's start

## Table of contents

1. *Setup* - [Create your Astra DB instance](#)
2. *Setup* - [Create your Keys](#)
3. *Setup* - [Load the project into Gitpod](#)
4. *Setup* - [Setup your environment](#)
5. *Prepare DB* - [Create the Schema](#)
6. *Prepare DB* - [Load the Data](#)
7. *Application* - [Setup configuration](#)
8. *Application* - [Start the application](#)
9. [Homework instructions](#)


## 1. Create your Astra DB instance

> Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-AstraDB-Instance) create a database.

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `better_reads`|


## 2. Create your Credentials, Keys, Token

> Leveraging [Token creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-Astra-Token) create a token. (`AstraCS:blablablabla`)

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Role**| `Database Amimistrator`|

## 3. Setup Gitpod

- Start gitpod with the button below *(right-click open in new tab)*

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads)

- Wait for the environment to initialize until you are asked to provide your token:

```
âœ” Please paste the Database Admin Token here
```

- Enter your tokeb `AstraCS;blahblahblah` and press enter. Wait for all the operations to complete.


## 4. Setup Gitpod

- Interactive Cqlsh to Astra

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/cqlsh
```

- You can start the app

```
cd /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Sample CQL command

```
set -a && source /workspace/workshop-betterreads/.env && set +a && /workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/cqlsh-astra/bin/cqlsh -u token -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip \
  -e "use better_reads;describe tables;"
```

You will now create a database with a keyspace in it (a _keyspace_ can contain _tables_.
Today's application needs just a single table: it will be created for you the first time you
will launch it, so don't worry too much).
