# üèÅ Start Hands-on

## 5. Create Astra DB Instance

> Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-AstraDB-Instance) create a database.

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `better_reads`|

If you already have a DB, you may need to resume it using the [Resuming Guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/How-to-resume-a-database) and simply add the `better_reads` keyspace.

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 6. Create Astra Token

> Leveraging [Token creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-Astra-Token) create a token. (`AstraCS:blablablabla`)

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Role**| `Database Amimistrator`|

## 7. Start and setup Gitpod

- Start gitpod with the button below *(right-click open in new tab)*

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads)

- Wait for the environment to initialize until you are asked to provide your token:

```
‚úî Please paste the Database Admin Token here
```

- Enter your token `AstraCS;blahblahblah` and press enter. Wait for all the operations to complete.

```bash
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

[INFO] Total time:  18.676 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2022-02-14T13:00:07Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## 8. Work with CqlSh

#### ‚úÖ 8a. Open new Terminal

It would be handy to have access to this CQLSH while doing the exercises and check the content of the database.

- Open a new terminal with the proper icon as show below

![new_terminal2](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/new-terminal1.png?raw=true)

or 

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/new-terminal2.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 8b. Enter the interactive Cqlsh *(it is a script we have created for you)*

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/cqlsh
```

- It should look like

```
Connected to cndb at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 6.8.0 | Cassandra 4.0.0.6816 | CQL spec 3.4.5 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
token@cqlsh>
```

- List Keyspaces with 

```sql
describe keyspaces;
```

- Check that our keyspace `better_reads` is there

```
token@cqlsh> describe keyspaces;

system_virtual_schema  system_auth   data_endpoint_auth  system_traces
temporal_visibility    system_views  better_reads        ecommerce    
netflix                system        spring_petclinic    todos        
system_schema          datastax_sla  native_java         feeds_reader 

token@cqlsh> 
```

- List `better_reads` tables

```
use better_reads;
describe tables;
```

- Check that expected tables are there

```bash
token@cqlsh:better_reads> describe tables;

author_by_id  books_by_user  book_by_id  book_by_user_and_bookid
```

`DARK MAGIC !`

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 9. Load Data with DSBulk

- Check you have the dataset ready. In the `BASH` terminal (not the cqlsh one). You should see the cql file `book_by_id_0.csv`.

```
ls -l /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/
```

- Check how many rows. It should have more than 250k.

```
wc -l /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/book_by_id_0.csv
```

- Check that Datastax bulk loader is properly installed *(Dark magic again)*

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk --version
```

- Import the DataSet with the following command

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk load \
   -c csv \
   -k better_reads \
   -t book_by_id \
   -u token \
   -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} \
   -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip \
   -url /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/book_by_id_0.csv
```

- The batch is running and should be able to see the throughput at 3700 records per second.

```

```

> TODO ‚ö†Ô∏è THE INPUT FILE HAS STILL 0.1% error and import will FAILED AFTER 150k records

## 10. Use Application in anonymous

- It would be handy to know the URL of the application

```
gp url 8080
```

- Start the app

```
cd /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Output

```

 BetterReads with Spring Boot, String Data, Spring NVC, Spring security
 An application by JabaBrains.


 The application will start at http://localhost:8080

```

- In a new tab open the application with the above url

```
gp preview $(gp url 8080)
```

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app1.png?raw=true)

- In the search item look for `Glimpses of ancient Sowams` you can search to whatever you want it will request open library ut during this workshop you only imported a subset of books, let us pick one you imported

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app2.png?raw=true)

- Select the first item, if you select the second you will hit the page book not found as this book is not in the DB

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app3.png?raw=true)

This is only what we can do at this point. To mark the book as read we will need to authenticate against `GITHUB`. 


[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 11. Setup Github Apps

Default settings in `application.yml` use an application from `DatastaxDevelopers` but it must run locally.

As each attendee has a different URL in gitpod you will have to create your own github APPS. Let's do this together.

- During github setting we will have to enter a callback URL. To know which one enter use the following command

```
clear
echo $(gp url 8080)/login/oauth2/code/github
```

- Login to your github account and go to `Organizations`

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps1.png?raw=true)

- There scroll down to locate the last item of the menu `Developer Settings` *(hopefully you have not as many organizations as me)*

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps2.png?raw=true)

- Click button `[New Github Apps]` on the page

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps3.png?raw=true)

- You will be asked to login again for security reasons, then fill the form to register a new Github App

|Name| Value|
|---|---|
| `Github App name`| The application name shown to user |
| `Homepage URL`| Can be anything, just the app (gp url 8080) |
| `CallbackURL`| Call back url the one listed above |


![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps4.png?raw=true)

- Uncheck the Webhook active box

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps5.png?raw=true)

- In user permission put the email adress and read and profile as red/writes.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps6.png?raw=true)

- Allow `Any Account` to access

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps7.png?raw=true)

- You got now your `Client ID`, check here it looks like `lv1....`. Click Generate a new client secret

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps8.png?raw=true)

- Now you have it all time to update the application

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps9.png?raw=true)

- Save the change

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps10.png?raw=true)


```
You are now doomed we will now mine cryptos with your github account 
Just kidding.
``` 

- Open `application.yml`

```
gp open /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp/src/main/resources/application.yml
```

- Changes keys `client-id` and `client-secret` with your values

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps11.png?raw=true)
