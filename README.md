## 1. Objectives

* Discover how to use the following technologies: 
  * **Astra DB** (a Database-as-a-service built on Apache Cassandra)
  * **Spring Data:** the Object Mapping layer of Spring
  * **Spring Security:** how to handle authentication
  * **Spring MVC:** how to expose REST API and controllers
  * **Thymeleaf:** how to build a user interface with Spring
  * **Spring Test:** How to run tests

### 2. Acknowledgement

This application has been built based on the work of [**Java Brains**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q), a famous youtuber *(500k+ subscribers)*. On his channel you can find the full [*Code with me Series*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxVGFBRpEFM), 16 episodes for building this application step-by-step. The link to each episode is provided at the end of this readme.

## 3. Frequently asked questions

<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine, If you do so, you will need the following
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>JDK 8+</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>Maven 3.6+</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>We can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.

## 5. Create Astra DB Instance

> Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-AstraDB-Instance) create a database.

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `better_reads`|

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 6. Create Astra Token

> Leveraging [Token creation guide](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Create-an-Astra-Token) create a token. (`AstraCS:blablablabla`)

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Role**| `Database Amimistrator`|

## 7. Start and setup Gitpod

- Start gitpod with the button below *(right-click open in new tab)*

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads)

- Wait for the environment to initialize until you are asked to provide your token:

```
‚úî Please paste the Database Admin Token here
```

- Enter your tokeb `AstraCS;blahblahblah` and press enter. Wait for all the operations to complete.

## 8. Work with CqlSh

- Interactive Cqlsh to Astra

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/cqlsh
```

- CQL command to Astra (not interactive)

```
set -a && source /workspace/workshop-betterreads/.env && set +a && /workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/cqlsh-astra/bin/cqlsh -u token -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip \
  -e "use better_reads;describe tables;"
```

*Notes that all tables are created   MAGIC !*

## 9. Load Data with DSBulk

TBD with DSbulk 

## 6. Start the app

- Start the app

```
cd /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

You will now create a database with a keyspace in it (a _keyspace_ can contain _tables_.
Today's application needs just a single table: it will be created for you the first time you
will launch it, so don't worry too much).
