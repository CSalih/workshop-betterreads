OL1102688W,"[\"OL113803A\"]","[\"John Gould Fletcher\"]","“An interpretation of the life of this strange painter, whose mixed French, Spanish, and Peruvian ancestry seemed to destine him to a life of unconventionality and revolt. It traces his bohemian life in Paris, Brittany, and the South Seas, where he sought a refuge from the restraints and artificialities of modern life. Illustrations from Gauguin’s paintings. Will interest readers who were fascinated by Noa Noa (Adelphi 1919), Gauguin’s own account of his life in the South Sea Islands.”
— A.L.A. Catalog 1926
“Within its small compass the author has contrived to include not only the salient features of Gauguin’s life, but a full exposition of Gauguin‘s ideas, showing their relation to the general ideas of his day, and an ample discussion of Gauguin’s art with its subtle relationships to the work of other great painters, past and present. The true story is an unhappy one. Gauguin had a rough savage nature; to most of his associates he must have seemed just such an inhuman and overbearing egoist as the novelist represents.”
“A straightforward and competent account of one of the least understood artists of his day.”
