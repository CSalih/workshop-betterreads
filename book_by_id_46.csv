Do you believe in magic?' When Zoe McCourt was sixteen she had been dazzled by the handsome and wealthy James Marshall. He had taken her innocence and left her to bring up their child alone. Now, after ten years of struggle, Zoe's life is finally coming together. Her son, Simon, is her pride and joy, and she is about to venture into business with her new-found friends Malory and Dana. There is even a hint of romance on the horizon, in the very sexy form of Bradley Charles Vane IV, a man whose wealth and good looks make Zoe a little wary but seriously tempted to throw caution to the wind. But before she can embrace her future she has a challenge to face. For Malory, Dana and Zoe have been chosen to undergo a quest to free the souls of three demi-goddesses trapped by an ancient evil. It is a challenge that promises great riches but also grave danger. And, of all of them, Zoe has the most to lose. Three women. Three keys to find. If one fails, they all lose. If they all succeed - money, power and a new destiny awaits. It will take more than intellect, more than determination. They will have to open their hearts, their minds, and believe that everything and anything is possible.","Key of Valour","[\"492814\", \"319391\", \"1972043\", \"3328731\", \"8064979\", \"8739483\", \"8992576\", \"9123535\", \"10775373\", \"10571173\", \"12065218\"]",2009-10-17

Lieutenant Seth Buchanan's homicide investigation was thrown into turmoil when Grace Fontaine turned up very much alive--and in possession of one of the huge blue diamonds known as the Stars of Mithra.

Treasures Lost, Treasures Found

Kate Hardesty had inherited a dream: a pile of mysterious charts and notebooks, mapping the way to sunken treasure. Determined to complete her late father's explorations, she returned to the island where she grew up and hired deep-sea diver Ky Silver--the man she'd left behind four years ago. But working with Ky meant more than searching for gold...it meant finding a priceless treasure Kate hadn't been looking for.","Treasures","[\"2409775\"]",2009-10-17
